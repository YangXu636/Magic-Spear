This mod allows you to transform your spear into a magical one that can automatically track and launch at enemies.

When you press the designated key in the settings (default is N), the spear in your hand transforms into a magical spear. These spears will target and attack the nearest creature within range, except for those that have a high affinity towards you. You need to face the direction in which you wish to launch the magical spear to allow its release. However, if you suddenly change direction, the spear might fly in the opposite direction. I am trying to  optimize this aspect.

This mod is also effective in multiplayer online mode.

You can also press the designated key (default is U) to revert your magical spear back to a normal spear.

When the color option in the configuration is enabled, a magical spear that detects danger will turn yellow, and it will turn red when attacking a creature.

The key bindings can all be changed in the mod configuration.

I am learning how to develop a well-rounded mod, and I greatly appreciate all the comments and suggestions, they have been helpful to me.

Changelog: March 9th

这个mod允许你将你的矛变成可以自动追踪敌人和发射的魔法矛。

当你按下设置中的按键时（默认为N），你手中的矛变成魔法矛；它们会攻击范围内离你最近的任一生物，除非该生物对你有高好感。你需朝向魔法矛的发射方向来允许矛的发射，但在你突然改变方向时它们可能会飞向反向，我正在尝试优化这一部分。

该mod在多人联机中同样起效。

你也可以按下按键（默认为U）将你的魔法矛变回普通矛。

当配置中的颜色选项被启用时，检测到危险的魔法矛会变成黄色，攻击生物时会变成红色。

按键配置均可在模组配置中更改。

感谢所有的评论和建议，我正在学习如何写作一个完善的mod。
